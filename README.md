# PiModule

The PiModule is a tool to label concepts based on a tab-delimited lexicon specifying phrases of interest for labeling as well as phrases that can promote or inhibit that labeling.  The tool has been tested within Eclipse (version Photon) and includes an example lexicon that will be used by default.

To run the tool:
1.  Import the downloaded project folder into Eclipse (Menu: 'File' > 'Open Projects from File System ...').
2.  Right-click the pom.xml file within the PiModule project within Eclipse and run 'Maven Clean' (Menu: 'Run As' > 'Maven clean').
3.  Update the project by right-clicking the top PiModule project in Eclipse (Menu: 'Maven' > 'Update Project ...').  Make sure the PiModule project is selected in the dialog box that appears and select 'OK'.
4.  Navigate to the PiMaker.java file within the package 'gov.va.tvhs.grecc.PiModule.core' in the src/main/java folder within the project, right-click and run as a Java application (Menu: 'Run As' > 'Java Application').
